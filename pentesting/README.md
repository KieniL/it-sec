# Typical Steps for Pentesting

1. [Pre-engagement](#pre-engagement)
2. Intelligence Gathering
3. Threat Modeling
4. Vulnerability Analysis
5. Exploitation
6. Post Exploitation
7. Reporting

## Pre-Engagement

* What is the reason for the attack?
* Is it white or black-box testing?
* When are the tests done?
* Which and how many IP's or domains are tested? Are they internal or external?
* Are there Firewalls, Intrusion detencts, WAF or Loadbalancers?
* What to do after Penetration success? Should we get as far as we can (kill services or server, get root password) or stop and report it?
* How many and which applications should be tested?
* Is there a documentation for the application?
* Should a static or dynamic analysis be done?
* Should a fuzz test (sql injection) be done?
* Should there be a credential scan?
* Should Social Engineering be done?
* Is there a third party (other country)?
* Emergency contact information?
* Payment by Test, by IP or by Time?

## Information Gathering

### Several Commands

|Command|Description|
|----------|:-------------:|
|uname|get system information like release, version, name of kernel, processor, nodename|
|ping |get the IP Address of the destination|
|whois|get domain information, dns server, last changed date, ...|
|dig|get the dns entries of a destination|
|theHarvester (see useful links)|do an active test and get information on external threat landsacpe|
|nmap|scans for open ports (see useful links for more), a stealth scan (-sS) is a half handshake without connection and less likely to be discovered|
|sqlmap|do sql injection tests, see useful links|
